Problem 12

(six) 6. The Eclipse console throws an exception error. 

"Error: Main method not found in class Package.Class, please define the main method as:
   public static void main(String[] args)
or a JavaFX application class must extend javafx.application.Application"


(seven) 7. The parentheses are required by the java syntax; they are not a matter of style. The braces are optional since there 
        is only one statement in the IF statement.


(eight) 8. There is nothing syntacticly wrong with having an if statement without a condition. It is just that nothing happens 
        if that condition is met. Because the "xPos = c.getWidth();" is independent of the IF statement, "xPos = c.getWidth();" 
        is set only once and does not continuasly change (i.e. move the panel across the screen).


(nine) 9. See Pastebin link: http://pastebin.com/EEbwp13Q


(eleven) 11. a) The constructor that creates the title bar message is not referenced and called. The code compiles and runs, 
                but the title bar has no message.     
             b) Yes, the program compiles. It does not fill out the window, leaving it blank. The "void" makes the compiler think                 that "HelloGui()" is a method and not a contructor. The default constructor is used in place of the original 
                "HelloGui()" constructor. This leaves the window blank.


(twelve) 12. a) See Morning.java     
             b) See Morning.java     
             c) See MorningMoo.java
